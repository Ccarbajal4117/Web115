             <p style="float:right; text-align: left; margin: 3px; padding: 25px;"> You simply buy a car with all the money you saved up for a couple years, then you buy a German shepherd mix that was only a &#36;100 dollars at first, but spend hundreds of dollars more on maintnance and replacing everything she destroys. Finally to top it off, you go on vacation and spend all your money to have a little fun traveling the West Coast, while you still have to pay for college, and enjoy your full-time job that starts at 5 in the morning six days a week. </p>
